    **Backend For Frontend (BFF)** - Unified API Gateway for ClickDelivery Platform
    
    The BFF acts as the main facade between frontend and all microservices:

    - 🚚 **Delivery Service** - Delivery tracking and management
    - 🚗 **Rental Service** - Vehicle rental management
    - 🔔 **Notification Service** - Notifications and alerts
    - 📊 **Report Service** - Analytics and reporting
    
    ### Features:
    - ✅ Data aggregation from multiple services
    - ✅ JWT authentication (Auth0)
    - ✅ Request proxying with header propagation
    - ✅ Consolidated health checks
    - ✅ Response caching
    - ✅ Correlation ID tracking
